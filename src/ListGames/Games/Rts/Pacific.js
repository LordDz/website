text: "Play as both the american and japanese factions as you battle for control of Guadalcanal, starting with the landing of american forces on the beaches and continuing further into the island." +
    "The missions include both defensive and offensive missions, ranging from defending your base to stealth missions where you have to destroy american vehicles under the darkness of the night.",
notes: "One of my most played RTS games, these maps were made with cooperative gameplay in mind. Working alone, I scripted the missions and edited pre-existing maps terrain, as I thought that it would take too long to do all the terrain myself." +
"Also did some image editing and playtesting."
